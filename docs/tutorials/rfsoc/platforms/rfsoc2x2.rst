RF Clocking
-----------

The following figure shows a high-level block diagram for the clocking network:

.. image:: ../../../_static/img/rfsoc/readme/clk-rfsoc2x2.png

The PLLs used on this board are the:

* LMK04832
* LMX2594

The ``RESET/GPO`` pin of the LMK04832 is connected to the FPGA. The power-on
default for the ``RESET/GPO`` pin is as an input with a pulldown resistor. This
requires that hardware designs include a GPIO to remove reset from the LMK for
programming.

This can be done in the a CASPER design by using a software register and GPIO
yellow block.  Configure the software register to be ``From Processor`` with an
initial value of ``0``, a bitwidth of ``1`` and a bitfield data type of ``2``.
Configure the GPIO yellow block with I/O group set to ``custom``, I/O direction
``out``, Data Type ``Boolean``, and Data bitwidth of ``1``.

ADC Inputs
----------

This board only exposes two ADC inputs; one input on tile 1 and the other on
tile 3. Callout ``ADC 2`` (``J5``) is connected to tile 0 corresponding to ports
``m0X_axis_tdata`` on the ``rfdc``. Callout ``ADC 1`` (``J4``) is connected to tile 2
corresponding to ports ``m2X_axis_tdata`` on the ``rfdc``.
