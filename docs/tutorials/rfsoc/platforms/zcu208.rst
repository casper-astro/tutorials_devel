Notes
-----

As the ZCU208 is very similar to the ZCU216 much of the work to casperize this
platform was done at the same time. However, nothing has been tested on the
platform as there was no immediate access to this specifc board. There would be
a little bit of work to test a few things out, but by and large should be
complete.
